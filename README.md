# Euler

My solutions to the problems on Project Euler, in Java and Kotlin. Most of the problems also include comments detailing the solution. Java solutions require JDK 8+, my Kotlin version is 1.1.51.

You can find the problems in the [Project Euler Archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives), you can also download a text file containing the first 476 problems [here](https://github.com/davidcorbin/euler-offline).

Please try to solve the problems **on your own** before **not** looking at the solution, and trying some more!

*Seriously*, if you haven't tried please do..
