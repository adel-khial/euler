My solutions to the problems on Project Euler, in Java and Kotlin. Most of the problems also include comments detailing the solution.

You can find the problems in the [Project Euler Archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives), you can also download a text file containing the first 476 problems [here](https://github.com/davidcorbin/euler-offline).
